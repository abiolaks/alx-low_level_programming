# Understanding Pointers Arrays and Strings

## What is pointer and how to use them
__pointer__: hold the memory address of a variable.

* Pointers allow us to modify a varible outside a function.

* Pointer allow us to manipulate memory address of variable.

### Pointer Declaration
	type *var_name
var_name is a pointer to the data type.

## What is Arrays
__Arrays__: store collecton of items with the same data type. It is a conitquos space memory.

* Arrays are zero based and each element are accessed by index based.

## What are the difference between pointers and arrays
* Pointers point to memory addresss. it stores memory address.
* Arrays hold values in a space in memory but not the memory address.

### Similarities 
both can be accessed using pointer arithemetic.

## How to use Strings and how to manipulate them
__Strings__: are immutable. it is an array of character.
Some predefine function are availble for maniputating strings.

## Scope of Variable
This is the life time of a variable in a program.

### Type of Variable Scope

* _local Varaible_
The life time of a local variable expired with the function code block or block and is not acessing outside the code block
* _global variable_
The life time of this variable is accessible all throught the proram life time.
