# Understanding C Construct: Variables, control flow(if else and while).

__The different arithmetic operator to use are__ *,+,-,/.

* __logical operators to user are__ not ,and or !, || and &&

* The values consider true and false are 1 and 0

* Relational operators compare values and return either true of false.
examples inclued ==, =>, ,<=.
* Logical opertors perform logical operations on True an False.

* Declaring variables
	char c;
	int i;
	unsigned int i;

* Assigning values 
	char c ='c';
	i=34;

* Printing the Values of the following type below
	printf("%c\n, c) //printing a char
	printf("%d\n, i) //printing a string
	printf("%u\n, u) // unsigned int
	printf("%1.2f\n", ft) //floating point number

* Using while loop : repeated the execution of a statement until the condition if false.
	syntax
		int i = 0; //counter
		while(condition)
            {
			single-statement
			increment_operator
            }

* ASCII - American standard code for information interchange
It is a table of 7-bit encode represent of character in octal, hexedecimal and decimal. It contains 128 characters representer which are called the ascii character.

* The purpose of  the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 - This flags generate code for 32 and 64 bit machine.

## Project andd Description
* 0-positive_or_negative : This program will assing a random number to the variable n each time its is executed and output wether the random number produce is positive of negative.

* 1-last_digit.c : This program wether the last digit is greater than orless than 5.

* 2-print_alphabet.c : This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by linefeed.

* 3-print_alphabets.c : This prints the alphabet in lowercase then in uppercase by a newline.

* 4-print_alphabet.c : print alphabets in lower case. followed by new line:w

* 5-prints_numbers.c : this print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a newline

* 6-print_numberz.c :
