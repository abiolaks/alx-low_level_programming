# Description of Each Succecssive Project Task Undertaken

## Aim and Objectives : To Demonstrate the Understanding of programming construct in C Language.

### Tasks And Project
1. 0-preprocessor : This Script runs a Cfile throught the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
    * The Cfile name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
    * The output should be saved in the file c.
    
2. 1-compiler: This script compiles a C file but does not link.
    * The output file should be named the same as the C file but with the extention .o instead of .c.

3. 2-assembler: This Script generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
    * The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
    * The output file should be named the same as the C file, but the extension .s instead of .c.

4. 3-name: The script compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
    * The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.

5. 4-puts.c: This c program prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle. then apppend newline.
    * Use the function puts.
    * Your are not allowed to use printf
    * Your program should end with the value 0.
    
6. 5-printf.c: This c program prints exactly "with proper grammar, but ther outcomes is a piece of art," followed by a new line.
     8 Use the function printf
     * You are not allowed to use the functions puts
     * YOur program should return 0
     * Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc.

7. 6-size.c: This program prints the size of various types on the compute it is compiled and run on.
    * It produce the exact same output as in the example
    * Warnings are allowed
    * your program should return 0
    * You might have to install package libc6-dev-0386 on your linux to test the -m32 gcc option
